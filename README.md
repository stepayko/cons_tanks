Console game (8-bit style)

In june 2016 I released my first program, game - "Console Tanks".

It's coded on C language and runs in windows console (text mode).

There are such features:
- two types of walls (breakable and unbreakable);
- two types of ground (empty ground and dotted "grass" ground);
- three different maps;
- four AI enemies with different temperament;
- low system requirements;
- WIN and LOSE screens
